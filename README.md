# 📊 Group 7 — Dating App User Behavior Analysis

This repository contains our data visualization and exploratory analysis of user behavior on a dating app.  
The project follows a storytelling structure to present insights from user activity, swiping patterns, conversations, and clustering.

## 🔍 Project Overview
We explore the following key questions:

1. **Who are the users?**  
   Basic demographic and behavioral distributions.

2. **How do users behave on the app?**  
   Activity frequency, daily/hourly patterns, and engagement levels.

3. **How do they pursue matches?**  
   Swiping strategies, match rates, and preference signals.

4. **What happens after matching?**  
   Conversation patterns and message depth.

5. **What kinds of users exist?**  
   Behavioral archetypes discovered using **KMeans clustering** and visualized through a radar chart.
